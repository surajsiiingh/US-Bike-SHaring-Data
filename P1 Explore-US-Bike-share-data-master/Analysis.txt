These are my Interpretation and Understanding of the terms like Big O Notation for given Tasks

Big O Notation for each task:

Task0
The code is clearly CONSTANT therefore the worse case is 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(1)'

Task1
The code has ONE FOR LOOP among the data, therefore the worse case is 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)' 

Task2
The code has ONE FOR LOOP among the data, therefore the worse case is 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)'

Task3
Part A
The code has ONE SORTED FUNCTION, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(nlogn)' 

Part B
The code has ONE FOR LOOP among the data, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(n)' 

Task4
The code has ONE SORTED FUNCTION, therefore the worse case 'Big 0' Notation is: 'O(nlogn)'
